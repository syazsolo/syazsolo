  "about": "Software engineer with over 3 years of experience building web applications. I value simplicity in code and design, aiming for solutions that are both maintainable and delightful to use. While I am most utilized for frontend work, I am comfortable across the full stack. I view development as a form of stewardship—building whatever the project needs while actively maintaining the health and clarity of the codebase.",
