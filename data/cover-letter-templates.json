      "I am applying for this role because I see a clear intersection between your engineering needs and my strengths. While I am new to the professional AI domain, I am not starting from zero. My background is in Electronics Engineering (Robotics & Automation), which gave me my foundational understanding of control systems and logic.",
      "I approach my career with a philosophy of living passionately and following where my curiosity leads. Right now, I am deeply fascinated by the mechanics of learning. I recently realized that the way I train for football—making random movements, observing the impact, and iterating to replicate positive outcomes—is essentially Reinforcement Learning in practice. I am excited about the future and eager to see where applying this rigorous, inquisitive mindset to your ML pipelines will take me.",
      "Regarding the job description: the engineering fundamentals are already solved on my end.",
      "My professional career at IMT Tech and Webcada involved linking diverse systems, managing complex API integrations (Webhooks/WebSockets), and architecting maintainable codebases. I can immediately handle the \"backend infrastructure\" and \"service integration\" required. Additionally, I am well-versed in the frontend technologies you listed (React, Next.js), allowing me to deliver immediate value across the stack while I get up to speed on your specific ML model implementations.",
      "I am looking for a team where I can contribute stable, high-quality engineering while exploring this new field. I learn fast, build reliably, and am excited to see what we can build together."

          "Rapid Recycling: When I need to apply to a new company, I do not manually update a text file or a Google Doc. I revisit my portfolio, select the template, fill in the required fields (like company name and role), and a new, perfectly formatted PDF is generated instantly.",
