I am an experienced Software Engineer with a background in Full Stack development, APIs, and system architecture. I am applying because I am looking to pivot into AI, and I believe my engineering fundamentals are strong enough to deliver value immediately while I bridge the gap in specific ML frameworks.\n\nI am deeply curious about the intersection of human learning and machine learning. Recently, while analyzing how I learn to play football, I realized I was essentially practicing Reinforcement Learning on myself—making random movements, observing the impact, and iterating to replicate positive outcomes. I understand this is the fundamental logic behind how we train systems. As someone who views himself as a student of \"how we learn,\" I want to contribute to building the systems that are defining the future of intelligence.\n\nRegarding the job description: The infrastructure and API integration parts are not a problem.\n\nIn my professional career, I have specialized in connecting systems and ensuring data flows reliably.\n\nInfrastructure & APIs: At Webcada, I engineered real-time integrations using Webhooks and WebSockets (for Facebook Live) and managed complex shipping API connections. I understand how to link diverse systems together.\n\nArchitecture: At IMT Tech, I led an architectural redesign that reduced boilerplate by 70%. I know how to build stable, maintainable codebases—which is exactly what an ML pipeline needs to run at scale.\n\nFrontend & User Interface: I notice your listing mentions \"building intuitive user interfaces for LLM applications.\" This is my strongest domain. I can immediately take ownership of the frontend layer (React/Next.js) and the API interactions while I get up to speed on the Python/Flask backend components.\n\nI am aware there is a learning curve regarding the specific Python ML libraries. However, I have a track record of rapid adaptation—migrating from PHP to modern JS frameworks, and then to TypeScript/SvelteKit, delivering bug-free features in every environment.\n\nIf you are looking for a candidate who already knows every ML library by heart, I am not him yet. But if you are open to an engineer who understands code stewardship, solves the \"linking systems\" problem easily, and is genuinely obsessed with the mechanics of learning, I would love to discuss how I can help {{dear at where}} build reliable tools.\n\nThank you for your time and for considering an outsider’s perspective.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSyazani Zulkhairi\nsyazsolo.netlify.app\n019-209 9853"
