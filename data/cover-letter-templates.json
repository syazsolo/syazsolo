While I am currently pivoting into the AI domain, I am not starting from zero. My background is in Electronics Engineering (Robotics & Automation), where I first studied AI concepts and control systems.\n\nI am deeply fascinated by the mechanics of learning. I recently realized that the way I train for football—making random movements, observing the impact, and iterating to replicate positive outcomes—is essentially Reinforcement Learning in practice. This connection between human intuition, my robotics background, and machine logic is what draws me to this field. I am eager to apply this rigorous mindset to building and scaling your ML pipelines.\n\nRegarding the job description: the engineering fundamentals are already solved on my end.\n\nMy professional career at IMT Tech and Webcada involved linking diverse systems, managing complex API integrations (Webhooks/WebSockets), and architecting maintainable codebases. I can immediately handle the \"backend infrastructure,\" \"service integration,\" and \"frontend systems\" mentioned in your requirements. This allows me to deliver immediate value while I refresh my academic knowledge on specific ML model implementations.\n\nI am looking for a team where I can contribute stable, high-quality engineering while immersing myself in the AI field. I learn fast, build reliably, and am ready to work.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSyazani Zulkhairi\nsyazsolo.netlify.app\n019-209 9853"
